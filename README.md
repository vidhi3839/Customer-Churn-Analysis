## Problem Statement

Customer churn is the number of existing customers lost, for any reason at all, over a given period of time. It provides companies with an understanding of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and can identify potential changes in a company’s bottom line. (IBM)

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze customer behavior
- Identify factors contributing to churn
- Build a predictive model to identify high-risk customers
- Provide data-driven retention strategies
